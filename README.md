Handwritten Text Extraction System

Description:

The Handwritten Text Extraction System is a deep learning–based application designed to extract handwritten text from scanned images and documents and convert it into machine-readable digital text. The project leverages image preprocessing techniques and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to improve text recognition accuracy on handwritten inputs.

The system performs preprocessing steps such as noise removal, thresholding, and image normalization to enhance input quality before applying OCR using Tesseract. This helps in improving recognition accuracy compared to raw images. The extracted text can be used for digital storage, document processing, and automation tasks.

This project demonstrates practical application of computer vision, image preprocessing, and OCR techniques using Python and OpenCV.
